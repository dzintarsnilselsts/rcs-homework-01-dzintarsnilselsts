        <p class="text">Rome wasn't built in a day, but Rick and Morty was. Well, the pilot episode's script was, at least. Immediately after Harmon and Roiland sold their pitch to Nick Weidenfeld, the head of program development at Adult Swim, the duo got started on writing—a move that was spurred by Harmon's concurrent involvement as showrunner on the NBC comedy Community. With the knowledge that schedules would be tight, Harmon and Roiland knew that time was of the essence, and so they wrote the pilot in just six hours.</p>

        <h4>RICK'S CATCHPHRASE WAS A COMPLETE ACCIDENT</h4>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="text">What started out as an off-the-cuff remark has turned into an ironic yet iconic catchphrase. Rick first used "wubba lubba dub dub" to punctuate a gag, as he mistakenly believed it originated from stand-up comedian and talk-show host Arsenio Hall. It's later revealed that the phrase translates from English to the language of the Bird People as, "I am in great pain, please help me." But contradictory to its troubling true meaning, and much like its rise to prominence, Rick's "wubba lubba dub dub" was entirely accidental.

            The line was a last-minute rewrite, intended to be a reference to a bit from the slapstick trio the Three Stooges. When Roiland, who voices Rick, hopped in the recording booth, he got confused and spit the line out wrong, completely disregarding what was written. Roiland explained the mix-up: "It was scripted as parenthetical Larry or Moe from the Three Stooges—'wub wub wub wub wub.' And Rick was gonna fall on the ground and do that circle thing they do. And in the recording, that was a last minute rewrite that I didn't read, and I just didn't know what the f— I was looking at, and I just did it wrong."</p>
